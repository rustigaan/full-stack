# Rust full-stack PoC

A proof of concept of a full stack Rust project built on the same principles as [archetype-rust-axon](https://github.com/rustigaan/archetype-rust-axon).

An archetypal Rust project that uses AxonServer for Event Sourcing and CQRS.
This project uses the [dendrite crate](https://crates.io/crates/dendrite) ([rustic-dendrite git repo](https://github.com/dendrite2go/rustic-dendrite)) to connect to [AxonServer](https://axoniq.io/product-overview/axon-server).

This is a fork of the original archetype-rust-axon project with the intention to replace the React frontend with a frontend based on the Rusty [Yew-framework](https://crates.io/crates/yew) that can be compiled to Web-assembly.

# Nix

I got sidetracked and started to add building and packaging with Nix before I started on the Yew frontend. I followed the series of blog posts [Building a Rust service with Nix](https://fasterthanli.me/series/building-a-rust-service-with-nix) pretty closely. (The glue between Nix and Rust build tool Cargo is provided by [Crane](https://ipetkov.dev/blog/introducing-crane/).)

# Usage

Use this project as a template for new Event Sourced CQRS projects with AxonServer by clicking the "Use this template" button of GitHub.

## Preparation

The module `src/monolith/example_event/trusted_generated.rs` specifies my personal public key as the initial trusted key. So the application accepts only JWT tokens signed with my personal private key (which, hopefully, you don't have ðŸ™‚). Therefore, I recommend you to use the project as a template (or fork it) and run `bin/generate-module-for-trusted-keys.sh` to generate a version of `trusted_generated.rs` with a key that _you_ trust.

The file `etc/settings-sample.sh` contains sample settings for the project. It is advised to change at least the variable `ENSEMBLE_NAME` _before_ running `clobber-build-and-run.sh` when creating a new project from the template. The script `clobber-build-and-run.sh` automatically creates `etc/settings-local.sh` from `etc/settings-sample.sh` if it is not present. The file `etc/settings-local.sh` is ignored by git, so your local settings stay local.

## Building the project

First, (build and) start a container that runs the nix daemon as root:
```bash
$ bin/nix-container.sh
```

Then, open a non-root bash prompt in the container that runs the daemon:
```bash
$ bin/nix-exec.sh
```

The bash-shell inside the nix container is configured with `direnv`, so the first time that you log on (and each time you change `.envrc`) you have to accept the contents of `.envrc` with:
```bash
$ direnv allow
```

Now, the project can be built with:
```bash
$ nix build
```

And you can open a development shell (that has cargo) with:
```bash
$ nix develop
```

The script `clobber-build-and-run.sh` takes the following arguments (options only work in the given order; when switched around the behavior is undefined):

| option                  | description                                                                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-v`                    | once or twice for debug or trace mode respectively                                                                                                            |
| `--help`                | show a brief usage reminder                                                                                                                                   |
| `--tee <file>`          | write the output also to the given file                                                                                                                       |
| `--skip-build`          | skip the build phase, only clobber and run                                                                                                                    |
| `--build-uses-siblings` | expose the parent of the project to the Rust compiler, so that the build can reference sibling projects (_e.g._, for testing changes to the dendrite library) |
| `--back-end-only`       | build only the back-end, not the front-end<br/>(most useful with `--dev`)                                                                                     |
| `--no-clobber`          | skip removal of the docker volumes where the data is kept                                                                                                     |
| `--dev`                 | use the development version of the front-end<br/>React will automatically recompile changes to front-end code                                                 |

The file `etc/docker-compose.yml` is recreated from `etc/docker-compose-template.yml` by script `docker-compose-up.sh` for each run of `clobber-build-and-run.sh`.

The `--dev` mode deploys a `node.js` container that serves the sources directly from the `present` directory. React will dynamically recompile and reload sources when they are changed. Otherwise, an `nginx` container is deployed that serves the 'production' generated front-end.

There is a separate script `bin/docker-compose-up.sh` that only regenerates the `docker-compose.yml` and invokes docker compose up. It only takes options `-v1 (once or twice)` and `--dev`.

There is also a basic script `grpcurl-call.sh` that provides access to the gRPC API of the back-end from the command-line.
